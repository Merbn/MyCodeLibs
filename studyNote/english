    We've all forgotten how to be orignal.
    You use orignal when referring to something that existed at the begining of a process or activity,
or the characteristics that something had when ite began or was made.
    if you describe someone or their work as original ,you mean that they are very imageinative and have new ideas.
    Do you have any original suggestion?
    An original document or work of art is not copy.
    Is this the original manuscript?
